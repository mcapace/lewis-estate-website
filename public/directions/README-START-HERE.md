## 🔥 Main Problems Fixed

### 1. Image Sizing Issues ✅
**Before:** Images were stretched, cut off, or wrong aspect ratio
**After:** Perfect aspect ratios maintained on all screens using Next.js Image with proper `fill` and `object-cover`

### 2. Responsive Layout ✅
**Before:** Layout didn't adapt properly to mobile
**After:** Mobile-first design with proper grid layouts that stack correctly

### 3. Typography Scaling ✅
**Before:** Font sizes were fixed, too large on mobile or too small on desktop
**After:** Fluid typography using `clamp()` for smooth scaling

### 4. Spacing Consistency ✅
**Before:** Inconsistent padding and margins
**After:** Design system with consistent spacing scale

### 5. Color Accuracy ✅
**Before:** Colors didn't match Figma exactly
**After:** All Figma colors imported to Tailwind config

### 6. Performance ✅
**Before:** Slow load times, layout shifts
**After:** Optimized images, priority loading, no CLS

3. Restart dev server
4. Clear browser cache

### Issue: Fonts Look Wrong
**Solution:**
1. Verify font files in `/public/Fonts/`
2. Check globals.css @font-face paths
3. Hard refresh browser (Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + R)

**Solution:**
1. Open browser DevTools
2. Toggle device toolbar
3. Select iPhone 12 Pro
